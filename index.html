		<h1>Trevor Martin</h1>

		<p1>
			This is an incredibly long paragraph, designed such that it will eventually wrap
			around the picture of my face that's sitting on the right side of this HTML page. Isn't
			this such an incredibly fun piece of writing to be contained within this box? I love it.
			I'm not sure at what point I should stop typing this text, so I'm just going to
			keep it up for a little while. Perhaps I can fill the space with the US Constitution.
			We the people of the United States of America, in order to form a more perfect
			union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,
			promote the general welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our
			Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America -
			okay surely that's enough.
		</p1>

		<p2>
			Since you specified "one or more paragraphs," here's the optional text continuing from
			the first paragraph, only with a p2 tag so as to make things more interesting for me.
			I imagine the first one has already wrapped the image, so I won't type nearly as much
			in this one. Still, this is a fun bit of text as well, and the fact that it looks different
			from the last one behind the scenes despite looking so similar on the page is so exciting!

				First, the top of the page contains the header requested in the assignment
				description. My name is written as a heading, using the &lt;h1&gt; tag, and
				the CSS uses the float: right property, applied to the image by id #myhead. Finally,
				there is a paragraph of text, wrapped in &lt;p1&gt; and &lt;p2&gt; tags, that is long enough
				to collide with my image. Thanks to the float property, the text wraps the image.
			</li>
			<li>
				Within area 1 resides the same image of myself with a different ID. It is centered by giving area 1 the
				display: flex property and then the justify-content: center property. This sets the
				layout to flexbox and aligns on the major axis, defined with flex-direction: row. The
				image in HTML has the attribute height="100px" to ensure it fits the area.
			</li>
			<li>
				Within area 2, the same heading technique displays my name as used before, and the
				&lt;h2&gt; tag displays my (fake) phone number in smaller text. A phone icon is added
				from the icon repository at <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">fontawesome.com</a>. They provided a
				script to include that
				would allow access to a vast array of icons, some of which I used in this page. The
				icons are embedded with the &lt;i&gt; tag by convention.
			</li>
			<li>
				Area 4 uses a table. The &lt;table&gt; tag contains the table, with &lt;tr&gt; tags
				containing row data and &lt;td&gt; tags containing cell data within each row. By
				applying style info to the pseudoclass tr:nth-child(even) or tr:nth-child(odd), we
				can style every other tr element a specific way, giving us alternating colors. We can
				also use tr:hover to determine the style of tr elements when hovered over.
			</li>
			<li>
				Area 5 is very similar to area 1, only the image has no size, and the vertical axis
				is also constrained using align-items: center.
			</li>
			<li>
				Area 6 uses &lt;li&gt; tags contained within a &lt;ul&gt; tag to produce an unordered list of five
				items. Each item is wrapped in an &lt;a&gt; tag that allows it to link out to the website
				of the company named in the list, whose url is specified with the href attribute.
			</li>
			<li>
				Area 7 wraps paragraphs of text in three separate &lt;p&gt; tags, and within each one,
				a different style of text is used. The first uses bold, wrapped in &lt;b&gt; tags, the
				second uses italics, wrapped in &lt;i&gt; tags, and the third uses code formatting,
				wrapped in &lt;code&gt; tags.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reusing the icon library and the same approach as before, Area 8 applies &lt;a&gt; tags
				to each icon to allow them to link out to their respective websites. Additionally, justify-content:
				space-evenly
				is applied to ensure the icons are spaced evenly throughout the area.
			</li>
			<li>
				To size each area, a grid container is used. The container has two rows, the first auto-sized,
				the second filling the remaining space using 1fr. It also has two columns, the first 30% wide, the
				second
				filling the remaining space. Areas 1/2 are sized to 100px in height, which the auto size adapts to.
			</li>
			<li>The bottom-right cell
				is further divided into a flexbox with column orientation, which fills 100% of the available space. It
				contains
				two flexboxes for areas 4/5 and 6/7. These are row-oriented, fill 50% of the available space each, and
				contain
				the two areas as children. Areas 5/6 have their flex property set to ~21.4%, which resolves to about 15%
				of the
				canvas width when the parent flexboxes are 70% wide. Finally, area 8 resides at the bottom of this column-oriented 
				flexbox, with height fixed at 100px. That means the other two boxes will adapt to fill 50% of the remaining space 
				after those 100px are accounted for.
			</li>

						Within this paragraph of text, I will make use of the &lt;b&gt; tag in HTML.
						When writing a paragraph, sometimes it is necessary to put emphasis on your text,
						and the &lt;b&gt; tag does just that. It will <b>embolden</b> your text, helping
						give it that extra bit of pop on the page. <b>When used in longer applications,
							like you're seeing right now, it can really make readers pay attention to
							what you've written down on your page.</b> This is an extremely versatile tool.
						All you need to do to use it is start with a &lt;b&gt; tag, write your important
						text, then close with a &lt;/b&gt; tag. For example, "&lt;b&gt;Hello!&lt;/b&gt;"
						will look like: <b>Hello!</b> when completed. Hopefully this has been a helpful
						informational paragraph in teaching you about how to bold text using HTML.
