	<img id="myhead" src="me.jpg" alt="A picture of my face.">

	<p1>
		This is an incredibly long paragraph, designed such that it will eventually wrap
		around the picture of my face that's sitting on the right side of this HTML page.
		I'm not sure at what point I should stop typing this text, so I'm just going to
		keep it up for a little while. Perhaps I can fill the space with the US Constitution.
		We the people of the United States of America, in order to form a more perfect
		union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,
		promote the general welfare - okay surely that's enough.
	</p1>

	<p2>
		Since you specified "one or more paragraphs," here's the optional one more paragraph.
		I imagine the first one has already wrapped the image, so I won't type nearly as much
		in this one.
