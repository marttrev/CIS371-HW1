	<img id="myhead" src="me.jpg" alt="A picture of my face.">

	<p1>
		This is an incredibly long paragraph, designed such that it will eventually wrap
		around the picture of my face that's sitting on the right side of this HTML page.
		I'm not sure at what point I should stop typing this text, so I'm just going to
		keep it up for a little while. Perhaps I can fill the space with the US Constitution.
		We the people of the United States of America, in order to form a more perfect
		union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,
		promote the general welfare - okay surely that's enough.
	</p1>

	<p2>
		Since you specified "one or more paragraphs," here's the optional text continuing from 
		the first paragraph, only with a p2 tag so as to make things more interesting for me. 
		I imagine the first one has already wrapped the image, so I won't type nearly as much
		in this one.

						Within this paragraph of text, I will make use of the &lt;b&gt; tag in HTML. 
						When writing a paragraph, sometimes it is necessary to put emphasis on your text, 
						and the &lt;b&gt; tag does just that. It will <b>embolden</b> your text, helping
						give it that extra bit of pop on the page. <b>When used in longer applications, 
						like you're seeing right now, it can really make readers pay attention to 
						what you've written down on your page.</b> This is an extremely versatile tool. 
						All you need to do to use it is start with a &lt;b&gt; tag, write your important 
						text, then close with a &lt;/b&gt; tag. For example, "&lt;b&gt;Hello!&lt;/b&gt;" 
						will look like: <b>Hello!</b> when completed. Hopefully this has been a helpful 
						informational paragraph in teaching you about how to bold text using HTML.
